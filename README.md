# My First Journey into Vue.js ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to the `vue-todolist` repository, a simple and compact task management project developed as a practical exercise in learning and practicing [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

This mini-project features a simple but effective user interface, designed to be pleasant and intuitive for the user. The application allows users to create, view, mark as completed and delete daily tasks intuitively and quickly.

The application is not yet fully accessible. It will be improved at a later date.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks to your list with a title and due date.
- **View Tasks**: All your tasks are displayed in a clear list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that you have completed or are no longer necessary.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Double click on a task to mark it as completed or incomplete.

## Feature to Come: Accessibility Enhancements

One of my main goals moving forward is to enhance the accessibility of the Vue ToDoList application. I recognize the importance of creating web applications that are inclusive and usable for everyone, including people with disabilities.

## Installation

To install and run `vue-todolist` locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/emilie-v11/vue-todolist.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd vue-todolist

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application in development mode
npm run dev

# Compile and Minify for Production
npm run build

# Lint with ESLint - (https://eslint.org/)
npm run lint
```

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
